# AgentArena

> Benchmark the coding agents you already run locally on the same repo, the same task, and the same judges.

AgentArena is for people who already use coding agents in real work and want something more trustworthy than vibes.

It helps answer questions like:

- How strong is my current `Codex CLI + model X` setup on real repository tasks?
- Is `Claude Code` actually better than `Cursor` for the kind of fixes I care about?
- If I only run one local agent, how do I turn that into a repeatable capability baseline instead of a gut feeling?
- When a run looks surprising, how do I inspect the diff, judge failures, and trace instead of trusting one score?

AgentArena is local-first by default. You point it at your own repository, task pack, and locally installed agent CLIs. AgentArena handles shared setup, execution, judges, traces, and reports.

See **[docs/ui-and-adapters.md](./docs/ui-and-adapters.md)** for local UI bind address & auth rules, doctor/preflight semantics, and related contract tests. Quantitative line coverage: `pnpm test:coverage` (Node `--experimental-test-coverage`).

## Try It in 60 Seconds

No agent CLI needed. Just clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aabbcdl/AgentArena.git
cd AgentArena
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Run a benchmark with built-in demo agents (no auth required)
node packages/cli/dist/index.js run \
  --repo . \
  --task examples/taskpacks/demo-repo-health.json \
  --agents demo-fast,demo-thorough,demo-budget

# View the results in your browser
node packages/cli/dist/index.js ui
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4320`, load the result from `.agentarena/runs/`, and explore the dashboard.

When you're ready to benchmark real agents, just install their CLIs and run:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js run \
  --repo . \
  --task examples/taskpacks/official/repo-health.yaml \
  --agents codex,claude-code,cursor \
  --probe-auth
```

## How AgentArena Compares

| | SWE-bench | HumanEval | BigCodeBench | **AgentArena** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runs locally | ❌ cloud only | ❌ cloud only | ❌ cloud only | **✅ fully local** |
| Your own repo | ❌ fixed repos | ❌ synthetic | ❌ synthetic | **✅ any repo** |
| Custom tasks | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ YAML/JSON task packs** |
| Any agent CLI | ❌ SWE-agent only | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ 12+ adapters** |
| Offline capable | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ no internet needed** |
| Built-in UI | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ web dashboard** |
| CI integration | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ GitHub Actions** |
| Diff + trace | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ full audit trail** |

AgentArena is not a replacement for SWE-bench or HumanEval. It fills a different gap: **local, repeatable, agent-agnostic benchmarking on your own codebase**.

## Why This Exists

Most agent users are already past "how do I install an agent?" and into "which setup actually performs better on my work?"

AgentArena is built for that stage.

It gives you:

- a shared benchmark harness for agents you already use locally
- repeatable task packs with structured judges
- comparable outputs across both single-agent and multi-agent runs
- a browser UI that works as both launcher and report viewer
- reports you can keep, compare, share, and attach to CI

## Best Use Cases

- compare multiple local coding agents on the same repository task
- track whether one agent / model / provider combo is getting better or worse over time
- benchmark one agent repeatedly to estimate its current capability ceiling on your workflow
- run local smoke benchmarks before rolling a new agent or model out to a team
- generate HTML / Markdown / PR-comment artifacts from the same benchmark run

## What You Get From One Run

Even if you only benchmark one local agent, AgentArena is still useful. A single run gives you:

- a shared score and judge pass/fail breakdown
- changed files and diff scope signals
- duration, token usage, and cost when available
- trace output for replay and diagnosis
- comparable history once you keep running the same task over time

That means a single-agent run is not "just one score". It becomes the baseline you compare future runs against.

## What Makes The Result Credible

AgentArena is opinionated about fairness:

- same repository snapshot
- same task definition
- same setup commands
- same judge logic
- readiness checks before execution
- isolated workspaces per run
- structured report outputs after execution

If an adapter is blocked by missing auth or broken local setup, `agentarena doctor` should tell you before you trust the result.

## Current Capabilities

### Core flows

- `agentarena ui` for browser-based launch + report viewing
- `agentarena run` for direct CLI execution
- `agentarena doctor` for readiness and auth-aware checks
- `agentarena list-adapters` for adapter capability listing
- `agentarena init-taskpack` for starter task packs
- `agentarena init-ci` for GitHub Actions benchmark workflows

### Report outputs

Every run can generate:

- `summary.json`
- `summary.md`
- `report.html`
- `pr-comment.md`
- `badge.json`

### Judge coverage

Current built-in judge types include:

- `command`
- `test-result`
- `lint-check`
- `file-exists`
- `file-contains`
- `regex-match`
- `directory-exists`
- `compilation`
- `glob`
- `file-count`
- `snapshot`
- `json-value`
- `json-schema`
- `patch-validation`
- `token-efficiency`

### Adapter coverage

| Adapter | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `codex` | usable | configurable model + reasoning effort |
| `claude-code` | usable | auth-aware failure reporting |
| `cursor` | usable | local bridge, auth-sensitive |
| `gemini-cli` | usable | token and cost parsing |
| `aider` | usable | multi-model support |
| `copilot` | usable | token estimation |
| `qwen-code` | usable | JSON output parsing |
| `kilo-cli` | usable | OpenCode-based |
| `opencode` | usable | multi-provider open source CLI |
| `trae` | usable | event stream parsing |
| `augment` | usable | multi-model support |
| `windsurf` | blocked | auth stability issues |
| `demo-fast` / `demo-thorough` / `demo-budget` | built-in | no external setup required |

> **Note**: "usable" means the adapter can run normally, but may be sensitive to local auth state, CLI version changes, or install layout. See [Adapter Capabilities](./docs/adapter-capabilities.md) for detailed tier definitions.

## Quick Start

### Path A: benchmark the local agent you already use

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm doctor
node packages/cli/dist/index.js ui
```

Then open the local address printed in the terminal, usually:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4320
```

From there:

1. choose the repository you want to benchmark
2. choose a task pack
3. choose one or more local agents you already use
4. run the benchmark
5. inspect the result in the same UI

### Path B: get a single-agent baseline from the CLI

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js run --repo . --task examples/taskpacks/demo-repo-health.yaml --agents codex --output .agentarena/manual-run
```

This is the simplest "how strong is my current local Codex setup?" path.

### Path C: compare multiple local agents on one task

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js run --repo . --task examples/taskpacks/demo-repo-health.yaml --agents codex,claude-code,cursor --output .agentarena/manual-run
```

### Path D: fast product tour without external auth

```bash
pnpm demo
node packages/cli/dist/index.js ui
```

Use the built-in demo adapters when you want to verify the product flow before benchmarking real agents.

## Common Commands

Check local adapter readiness:

```bash
pnpm doctor
```

List adapters and capability metadata:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js list-adapters --json
```

Fail fast when one requested adapter is not ready:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js doctor --agents codex,claude-code,cursor --probe-auth --strict
```

Return machine-readable benchmark output:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js run --repo . --task examples/taskpacks/demo-repo-health.yaml --agents codex --json
```

Generate a starter YAML task pack:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js init-taskpack --template repo-health --output agentarena.taskpack.yaml
```

Generate a benchmark workflow for GitHub Actions:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js init-ci --task agentarena.taskpack.yaml --agents codex,claude-code
```

Run the browser-level web-report smoke test:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm test:web-report:e2e
```
