# AgentArena Overview

## What AgentArena Is
AgentArena is a local-first evaluation and replay tool for AI coding agents.

It lets you run multiple agents against the same repository task, inspect what they changed, compare outcomes, and export a shareable report.

The intended manual entry point is `agentarena ui`, which starts a local service and gives you a browser-based launcher plus report view in one place. Opening existing result files is a fallback path, not the primary workflow.

External CLI adapters are still subject to upstream tool behavior, login state, and provider compatibility. Use `agentarena doctor` as the readiness check before comparing results seriously.

## Core Use Case
Most teams evaluating coding agents still rely on anecdotes, screenshots, or one-off experiments.

AgentArena is built to answer a more useful question:

Which agent performs best on real tasks inside my repository, under the same constraints?

## Current Scope
The current version focuses on a runnable local benchmark loop:
- a browser-based local launcher through `agentarena ui`
- adapter preflight checks
- adapter capability matrix with support tiers
- isolated workspaces per run
- versioned task pack loading
- JSON and YAML task pack support
- task pack metadata and an official task pack library
- task-level environment allowlists
- browser-level smoke coverage for the local web report flow
- an optional Docker runner shell for more reproducible execution environments
- step-level environment overrides for setup, judges, and teardown
- built-in command, test-result, lint-check, file-exists, file-contains, regex-match, directory-exists, compilation, glob, file-count, snapshot, patch-validation, token-efficiency, json-value, json-schema judges
- diff detection
- JSON, Markdown, PR comment, badge, static HTML, and interactive web report generation
- support for demo adapters plus external CLI-based adapters

## Recommended Workflow

For manual use:
- run `agentarena ui`
- choose a repository path
- choose an official task pack or provide your own
- select one or more agents or Codex variants
- run the benchmark
- inspect the result in the same page

For CI or scripts:
- use `agentarena doctor`
- use `agentarena run`
- publish `summary.md`, `pr-comment.md`, `badge.json`, or `report.html`

## Design Principles

### Repo-native
The benchmark should run against a real codebase, not a toy prompt.

### Replayable
If a result looks surprising, you should be able to inspect the trace and understand why it happened.

### Adapter-driven
Different coding agents should plug into the same execution and reporting model.

### Honest About Readiness
If an agent is blocked by missing authentication or local setup, AgentArena should report that clearly instead of pretending the benchmark was fair.

## Near-term Priorities
- expand stable real-agent support (Devin, open-source agents)
- add Python task packs and builtin Python test repositories
- public leaderboard page for community-contributed results
- improve capability transparency and fairness documentation
